# Introduction to Programming

## Assignment: Task 4

*This final task is open-ended and is intended for those
who want a challenge! It is possible to pass the module very well
without attempting this.*

### The Problem

Python is an extremely powerful general-purpose language. A lot can be achieved using Python alone, but the true
power comes when it is combined with one of the many packages available. Many of these are assembled and curated
at the _Python Package Index_ (PyPI), affectionately known as _The Cheese Shop_.

This final task is open-ended and gives you the chance to explore a popular package
used in the world of Data Science - Pandas.

### The Task

First you will need to do some research into Python packages, so that you understand
the general concepts. You need to understand what it means to say that
a package has _dependencies_, and you need to understand how tools like
_pip_ and _Virtual Environments_ help programmers work with these.

There are YouTube videos a-plenty, and copious online docs to help you.

Pandas is in the Cheese Shop here - https://pypi.org/project/pandas/ - and
also maintains its own web presence here - https://pypi.org/project/pandas/ . There
is a useful tutorial and sample data set on the latter.

Your task is to use Pandas in conjunction with some freely available
data (such as that found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com)) to 
**do some Data Science**.

The only rules are:
* All Python packages used must be freely available.
* The data set you use must be "Open Data".
* You must produce a program (or suite of programs), not simply
  a set of interactive commands.

You should be prepared to demonstrate your program, and to explain
how it fits together.
